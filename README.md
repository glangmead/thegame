# thegame: Explorations in game engines

* `DynamicalSystems`: Use lenses and dynamical systems (e.g. as described in [David Jaz Myer's book](https://www.davidjaz.com/Papers/DynamicalBook.pdf)) to build up board games from a composition of smaller sets of rules. Inspired by [the TabletopGames framework](https://github.com/GAIGResearch/TabletopGames) and a desire to reimplement it in Swift with functional programming.
